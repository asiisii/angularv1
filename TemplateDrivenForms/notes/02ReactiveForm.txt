ANGULAR Reactive FORM

1. inorder to make HTML form to Angular form we have to make new instance of 
  a. formGroup class
    - we make formGroup class new instance for form tags (ngForm)
  b. formControl class
    - we make formControl new instance for each and every input fields inside the form (ngModel)

in Template - Driven form - we did all the declaration and validation almost everything in the HTML view page (ngForm)

Reactive form - we will do all the declaration and validation almost everything from scratch inside the component file.
