Usage of Angular Services
- we use it share data and common methods among components whether there is relationship between components or not

for example:
if Component 1 has button with click event and so does component 2 what we can do is create a button with click event in Angular Service and let both components use that method


Dependency injection
- instead of creating an instance on a service in a component, we can use Dependency injection framework that comes with Angular

example: 
@Component({
  selector: 'app-post',
  templateUrl: './post.component.html',
  styleUrls: ['./post.component.css'],
  providers: [PostService]
})
export class PostComponent {
  posts!: Array<any>;

  constructor(private postService: PostService) {
    // let postService = new PostService()
    this.posts = postService.postList
  }
}


*** if we don't add our service to "providers" in @Component directive we will get "ERROR NullInjectorError: " error message. "providers: [ServiceName]"
